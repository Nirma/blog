Not too different from most developers my interest in computers stems from my earliest
interactions with them, and for me that was the game "Kung Fu" on the NES.
There I was, six years old and I remember being board out of my skull.
It was raining so I couldn't really play outside, I gave up on my cat "Sam" wanting to
hang out with me for more than 30 seconds before running away and everything on TV sucked.
Check the VHS tapes to see if there was a movie to watch...nothing.

Some time later my dad came back home and I told him there was nothing to do because
it's raining and nobody is outside.
Thats when my dad busted out the Nintendo Entertainment System, hooked it up to the TV
and popped in the game "Kung Fu" and handed me that iconic rectangular controller with
a D-Pad on the Right, [Select] [Start] buttons in the middle and two shiny indented
red "B" and "A" buttons on the right. (Why was the order B, A and not A, B?)

At that time I thought video games are stupid, you just look at the TV and mash a plastic
controller, but being absolutely hooked on taekwondo at the time and having watched
bruce lee movies enough like "Game of Death" and "Enter the dragon" enough to turn blue
I thought it was worth a try since it was "Kung Fu".
